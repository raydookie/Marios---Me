== CsvImport

This is a Rails plugin.

It provides a controller method called +each_csv_row+ and
an accompanying view helper called +csv_fields+.

You can set the name of the file field param by passing it as the
first argument to the +csv_fields+ helper (it is 'csv_file' by default):
  
  <%= csv_fields :csv_file_upload %>

You may also specify the file field param as the first argument to the
+each_csv_row+ method in the controller (it too is 'csv_file' by default):

  each_csv_row(:csv_file_upload) do |row_hash|
    # …
  end
  
By default, when +each_csv_row+ is called, any exceptions raised in the
block will be rescued. The rows that triggered the exceptions will
then be displayed in a table as part of the output from +csv_fields+.

You can turn off rescuing by passing +false+ as the second argument
to +each_csv_row+:

  each_csv_row(:csv_file_upload, false) do |row_hash|
    # …
  end
  
+each_csv_row+ extracts the names of the fields from the CSV and applies
them to each row in the CSV creating a hash of key / value pairs.
The resulting hash for a row from the example below would look something like this:

  {:first_name => 'Bob', :last_name => 'Smith'}
  
If the first row does not contain the field names, +each_csv_row+ names
them from 0 to the length (- 1) of the first row:
  
  {0 => 'Bob', 1 => 'Smith'}

== Example

In your controller:

  class EmployeesController < ActionController::Base
    include CsvImport
    
    def import_employee_records
      each_csv_row do |row_hash|
        Employee.destroy_all if params[:destroy_all_first]
        Employee.create!(row_hash)
      end
    end
  end


In your view (don't forget to set :multipart => true):

  <h2>Import Employee Records</h2>

  <%- form_tag import_employees_path, {:multipart => true} do -%>
    
    <%= csv_fields %>
    
    <p>
      <%= check_box_tag :destroy_all_first %>
      <%= label :destroy_all_first, 'Destroy all existing employee records first.' %>
    </p>
  <%- end -%>

== Other View Helpers Included

All of these are called in +csv_fields+.
These exist for flexibility's sake. Feel free to mix
and match or even override +csv_fields+ in your own helper.

  csv_file_label(name = 'csv_file', text = 'CSV file to use', options = {})
  
  csv_file_tag(name = 'csv_file', options = {})
  
  csv_field_names_label(name = 'csv_field_names_in_first_row', text = 'Field name labels are in the first row.', options = {})
  
  csv_field_names_check_box_tag(name = 'csv_field_names_in_first_row', value = '1', checked = true, options = {})
  
  csv_rows_imported_content(wrapping_tag = :div, html_options = {})
  
  csv_bad_rows_table(header = 'Bad CSV rows', html_options = {})

== To-do

=== Allow for mapping of incoming field name labels to expected or preferred keys:

  each_csv_row(:non_useful_key_name => :key_expected, :other_key => :better_key) do |row_hash|
    # …
  end
  
Or even…

  each_csv_row(0 => :first_name, 1 => :last_name, 2 => :email) do |row_hash|
    # …
  end

=== Move the view helper methods to FormHelper, FormHelper::InstanceTag, and FormBuilder

Specifically FormBuilder so that things like this are made possible:

  <%- form_for @company do |f| -%>
    <p>
      <%= f.label :name, 'Company Name' %><br />
      <%= f.text_field :name %>
    </p>
    
    # yadda, yadda
    
    <p>
      <%= f.csv_file_label :employees_csv_file, 'Import Employees from a CSV' %><br />
      <%= f.csv_file :employees_csv_file %>
    </p>
    
    <p><%= f.submit 'Save' %></p>
  <%- end -%>
